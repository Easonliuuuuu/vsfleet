## Why vsfleet?

Managing multiple VMware vCenters traditionally requires juggling browser tabs, coping with slow web interfaces, or maintaining brittle scripts that fail completely when a single endpoint is unreachable.

**vsfleet** organizes each vCenter into a named **context**—similar to a `kubectl` context—keeping endpoints, credentials, network routes, and certificate policies strictly separated:

- 🌐 **Estate-Wide Multi-vCenter Queries**: Query every configured vCenter in parallel with a single command using `--all-contexts`.
- 🛡️ **Partial Failure Resilience**: Unreachable or timing-out sites do not block results; healthy vCenters remain responsive and usable.
- 🔒 **Strict Read-Only Safety**: Guaranteed zero mutation. Never powers VMs on or off, reverts snapshots, modifies networks, or alters inventory.
- 🔀 **Independent Proxy Routing**: Route each context independently through direct TCP, SOCKS5, HTTP, or HTTPS CONNECT proxies.
- 🔑 **Secure Credential Handling**: Zero plaintext passwords in `config.toml`. Resolves credentials dynamically via native OS keyrings, interactive prompts, or unattended sources.
- 📊 **Historical Drift & RVTools-Compatible Exports**: Capture immutable local SQLite snapshots, track drift over time, and export 19-sheet Excel workbooks for migration sizing.
- 🌐 **Distributed-Network Readiness**: Compare cross-cluster VLAN mappings, policy, MTU, host coverage, and affected VMs before migration.
- 🖥️ **Interactive TUI + Scriptable JSON**: Fast Bubble Tea terminal UI with local workstation handoffs (SSH, web browser, clipboard) alongside stable JSON for automation.

### Feature comparison

| Capability | `vsfleet` | `govc` | PowerCLI | vSphere Web Client |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Multi-vCenter query in one command | **Yes** | No | Yes | No |
| Estate-wide resource search, every kind at once | **Yes** | No | Per cmdlet | Per vCenter |
| Partial results when one site fails | **Yes** | No | Custom error handling | Browser timeout |
| Per-context proxy routing | **Yes** | Global env | Global env | Browser proxy |
| Read-only safety guarantee | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Historical drift and snapshot age | **Yes** | Export only | Custom script | Point-in-time |

> PowerCLI connects to several vCenters at once and fans most cmdlets out across them; what it does not give you is one query spanning every resource kind, or partial results by default when a site is unreachable. `govc` and PowerCLI are both full read-write toolkits — that is a capability vsfleet deliberately does not have, not a gap in theirs.

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```sh
brew install --cask easonliuuuuu/tap/vsfleet
```

### Pre-built binary (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Download an archive for your operating system and CPU architecture from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/releases):

```sh
# Example for Linux x86_64
curl -sSL https://github.com/Easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/releases/latest/download/vsfleet_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz vsfleet
sudo install -m 0755 vsfleet /usr/local/bin/
```

Archives are available for Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), and Windows (amd64 and arm64).

### Go install

Requires Go 1.25 or newer:

```sh
go install github.com/easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/cmd/vsfleet@latest
```

### Container (Automation & CI)

The official image is published on GitHub Container Registry for Linux `amd64` and `arm64`:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/easonliuuuuu/vsfleet:latest compatibility report --sheet vInfo -o json
```

*Note: The container runs as an unprivileged user and is designed for unattended commands, assessments, and exports. For the interactive terminal UI, install the native binary. See the [Containers guide](https://easonliuuuuu.github.io/vsfleet/containers/) for mounted configuration, secrets, and private CAs.*

## Quick Start

### 1. Test drive without a vCenter

Explore the full terminal UI immediately with zero configuration and zero credentials:

```sh
vsfleet demo
```

`vsfleet demo` opens the interface on a synthetic three-vCenter estate: two healthy sites on different routes and one whose proxy refuses the connection. It reads no configuration, opens no keyring, dials nothing, and writes nothing back. Every screen is marked `DEMO · SAMPLE DATA`.

### 2. Connect your first vCenter

Running `vsfleet` with no contexts configured opens the interactive setup wizard:

```sh
# Launch the setup wizard
vsfleet context add

# Test connectivity, routes, and authentication
vsfleet context test prod
```

### 3. Search and inspect inventory

Launch the interactive terminal UI or run direct CLI queries:

```sh
# Open the interactive Bubble Tea terminal UI
vsfleet

# List specific resources
vsfleet vm list
vsfleet host list --context prod

# Search across every configured vCenter at once
vsfleet search ubuntu --all-contexts
```

### 4. Capture and export an assessment

Capture an immutable local SQLite assessment and export an Excel workbook for migration planning or audit:

```sh
# Capture state across all contexts
vsfleet assessment run --all-contexts --label q3-audit

# Export RVTools-compatible workbook
vsfleet assessment export --format rvtools --file estate.xlsx
```

---

## Core Capabilities

### Interactive Terminal UI (TUI)

Run `vsfleet` to open an interactive dashboard built with Bubble Tea:
- **Fast Fuzzy Filtering**: Press `/` to filter the active view or `Tab` to widen to an estate-wide search.
- **Estate Diagnostics**: Press `d` to run immediate diagnostics on any selected vCenter.
- **Local Workstation Handoffs**: Detail-pane actions (SSH to a VM or host, open a resource in your workstation browser, copy an identifier) launch real local processes without issuing modifying vSphere API calls — see [the TUI guide](docs/tui.md#detail-pane-actions).

### Estate-Wide Search & Inventory

Supported resource kinds include `vm`, `template`, `host`, `cluster`, `vapp`, `datastore`, and `network`. All commands accept `--filter` / `-f` and work across single contexts or the entire estate:

```sh
vsfleet host list --context prod --filter esxi-07
vsfleet datastore list --all-contexts -f nvme
vsfleet search nvme --kind datastore --limit 20
```

Use `-o json` for automation with `jq` or custom tooling:

```sh
vsfleet vm list --all-contexts -o json | jq
```

### Historical Audits & Drift Tracking

Assessments are stored locally in an immutable SQLite database, giving your estate an auditable history rather than a series of disconnected spreadsheets:

```sh
vsfleet assessment diff q3-audit latest   # What changed between two captures
vsfleet assessment trends capacity        # Compute and storage trends over time
vsfleet assessment capacity latest        # Attribute datastore growth and project free space
vsfleet assessment trends churn           # VMs created and destroyed
vsfleet assessment snapshots              # Snapshot ages, oldest first
vsfleet health latest                     # Health findings on stored evidence
vsfleet blast-radius datastore ds-prod-01 # What depends on a datastore
```

### Migration & Sizing Exports (RVTools Interoperability)

vsfleet exports stored assessments for migration planning, sizing, audit, and downstream workflows. The XLSX export uses the `rvtools` format name for interoperability with tools that consume selected worksheet layouts:

```sh
vsfleet assessment export --format rvtools --file estate.xlsx
vsfleet assessment export --format csv --file ./audit-csv/
```

- **Byte-Identical Consistency**: Exporting the same stored assessment twice produces byte-identical files accompanied by a SHA256 receipt.
- **Audit Coverage Sheet**: Every export includes a `vsfleetCoverage` sheet detailing what collected, what failed, and why per vCenter. A partial estate is reported as partial rather than handed over as whole.
- **Schema Transparency**: Inspect every column, type, unit, and nullability without needing a vCenter or configuration:
  ```sh
  vsfleet compatibility report --sheet vPartition
  ```

<details>
<summary><strong>Supported Worksheet Layouts (19 sheets)</strong></summary>

vsfleet renders the following 19 worksheet layouts:

`vInfo` &bull; `vCPU` &bull; `vMemory` &bull; `vDisk` &bull; `vPartition` &bull; `vNetwork` &bull; `vTools` &bull; `vHost` &bull; `vHBA` &bull; `vNIC` &bull; `vSwitch` &bull; `vPort` &bull; `vSC+VMK` &bull; `vMultiPath` &bull; `vCluster` &bull; `vRP` &bull; `vDatastore` &bull; `vSnapshot` &bull; `vHealth`

- **Guest Filesystem Usage (`vPartition`)**: Measures guest usage via VMware Tools. VMs with no running Tools contribute no rows, and `vsfleetCoverage` reports answering status.
- **Host Configuration Sheets**: HBAs, multipath LUN aggregates, physical NICs, standard virtual switches, standard port groups, and VMkernel adapters are pulled directly from host properties without querying separate manager endpoints.

*Compatibility is limited to the listed worksheet names and columns. This is an interoperability export, not RVTools and not a replacement for it.*

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> vsfleet is a personal open-source project, not an official Dell Technologies product, and is not sponsored, endorsed, or supported by Dell Technologies. Its export interoperability was independently implemented without RVTools source code or non-public documentation. RVTools is a Dell Technologies product; references to RVTools describe export-file interoperability only.

## Security & Safety Guarantees

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict read-only safety guarantee:** vsfleet is an inspection and diagnostic tool. It does not power on/off VMs, create or revert snapshots, modify networks, provision resources, or delete inventory objects. That guarantee is about the vSphere API specifically: the TUI's detail-pane handoff actions (SSH to a VM or host, open a resource in the vSphere/Host Client, copy an identifier) launch real processes on your own workstation, never a vSphere API call — see [the TUI guide](docs/tui.md#detail-pane-actions).

- **Zero Plaintext Passwords on Disk**: Passwords are never written to `config.toml`. Credentials resolve dynamically via the native OS keyring (Secret Service, macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager), an interactive prompt, or unattended sources (`env:<VAR>`, `file:<path>`, `exec:<program>`).
- **Per-Context Proxy Isolation**: Route each vCenter independently via direct TCP, SOCKS5, HTTP, or HTTPS CONNECT proxies.
- **TLS Thumbprint Pinning**: Explicitly pin SHA256 or SHA1 thumbprints for private or self-signed certificates.
