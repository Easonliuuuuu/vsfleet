## Inventory and search

Supported resource kinds are `vm`, `template`, `host`, `cluster`, `vapp`,
`datastore`, `network`, `dvswitch`, and `resourcepool`. Inventory commands
accept `--filter` / `-f`, repeatable `--where`, and opt-in `--wide` metadata
columns:

```sh
vsfleet host list --context prod --filter esxi-07
vsfleet datastore list --all-contexts -f nvme
vsfleet vapp list --all-contexts
vsfleet vm list --where 'tag=Production' --where 'cpu>=8' --wide
vsfleet datastore list --where 'free_percent<15'

vsfleet search ubuntu --all-contexts
vsfleet search --tag migration-wave-2 --wide
vsfleet search nvme --kind datastore --limit 20
```

`--where` uses `field operator value`, with `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and
`>=`. Repeat the flag to AND predicates. Values may be quoted when they contain
spaces. Built-in fields are case-insensitive; metadata values are exact and
case-sensitive. Use `tag=Production` for any category,
`tag.Environment=Production` for a category-qualified tag, and
`custom.environment=prod` (or `custom.#123=prod`) for custom attributes.
Numeric comparisons are numeric rather than lexical. Missing or unavailable
metadata never matches, including a negative predicate.

Stored captures are queried offline with the same evaluator:

```sh
vsfleet assessment inventory latest --where 'custom.environment=prod' --wide
vsfleet assessment findings latest --where 'tag=PCI' -o json
```

JSON inventory, search, and findings output includes normalized metadata,
source status, and object/context provenance. A vCenter that does not expose a
metadata source remains usable; scalar inventory is retained and the affected
source is reported as unavailable.

Results from healthy contexts remain available when another context fails. The
failure is reported separately with its context and diagnostic information.

## Object detail and infrastructure subresources

`vsfleet <kind> show <name>` prints one object's full collected evidence —
identity, provenance and configuration — rather than a list row. The name may
match more than one object across contexts; when it does, `show` reports the
ambiguity and lists the candidates instead of guessing, and `--context`
narrows it to one:

```sh
vsfleet vm show web-01
vsfleet vm show 5029c07a-1b3e-4d2f-9c11-8a7e6f0d4b52   # by instance UUID
vsfleet host show esxi-01 --context prod
vsfleet datastore show nvme-01 -o json
```

Host storage and network evidence that is already collected for assessments —
HBAs, physical NICs, standard switches, port groups, VMkernel adapters and
multipath LUNs — is queryable directly, across every host on the context or
narrowed to one with `--host`:

```sh
vsfleet host hba list --host esxi-01
vsfleet host vswitch list
vsfleet host multipath list --host esxi-01 -o json
```

Distributed switch, resource pool and snapshot evidence work the same way:

```sh
vsfleet dvswitch list
vsfleet dvportgroup list --switch dvs-prod
vsfleet resourcepool list --wide
vsfleet snapshot list --vm web-01
```

## Datastore file browsing

`vsfleet datastore files` exposes the same read-only datastore browser and
bounded recursive search the terminal UI offers. Listing is lazy and
non-recursive — one query per directory — while `find` searches the whole
datastore and reports when it stops short of a complete answer:

```sh
vsfleet datastore files list nvme-01
vsfleet datastore files list nvme-01 vm/web-01/
vsfleet datastore files find nvme-01 '*.vmdk'
vsfleet datastore files find nvme-01 orphan.vmdk --limit 20 -o json
```

A VMDK result includes relationship evidence where it is known: which VM or
template currently references it, and the confidence recorded by the most
recent stored assessment. A datastore name that matches more than one
datastore — across contexts, or, rarely, within one context spanning several
datacenters — is refused rather than guessed at; narrow it with `--context`.

## Importing RVTools exports

`vsfleet import rvtools` adapts an RVTools-compatible XLSX export into a new
stored assessment run, entirely offline — no configuration, credentials, or
vCenter connection is used:

```sh
# Preview what would be imported without writing anything
vsfleet import rvtools estate.xlsx --dry-run

# Import it, labelled, with an explicit capture time
vsfleet import rvtools estate.xlsx --label pre-migration --captured-at 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z

# Once imported, every stored-evidence command works on it like a live capture
vsfleet assessment list
vsfleet vm history web-01
vsfleet assessment diff pre-migration wave-1
```

An imported run's `assessment list` row shows `rvtools-import` as its source,
and its note records the source filename, a SHA-256 fingerprint of the file,
the capture time and where it came from, the parser profile
(`rvtools-v2`) and the worksheets recognized and ignored. It is never mistaken
for a live capture.

### What is read

Worksheets are matched by name and columns by header, never by position, so a
workbook with extra or reordered columns still imports:

| Worksheet | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `vInfo` | VMs and their identity (required) |
| `vCPU`, `vMemory` | VM CPU and memory, when `vInfo` lacks the column; a disagreement with `vInfo` is warned about and `vInfo` wins |
| `vDisk`, `vNetwork`, `vTools`, `vPartition`, `vSnapshot` | per-VM disks, NICs, Tools state, guest filesystems and snapshots |
| `vHost`, `vCluster`, `vDatastore` | the host, cluster and datastore collections |
| `vSwitch`, `vPort` | host virtual switches and port groups, joined to the host by `Object ID` |
| `dvSwitch`, `dvPort` | distributed switches and their port groups |

Everything else is listed as an ignored worksheet, and the dry run lists the
recognized, ignored and missing columns of each worksheet that was read.

### Missing evidence is never good news

The one rule every mapping answers to: imported evidence may reduce
confidence, but the lack of a workbook field must never improve a verdict.

- A worksheet that is **absent** — or present without the capacity columns that
  make its rows trustworthy (`# Cores`, `# Memory` and `Speed` for `vHost`;
  `NumCpuCores`, `TotalCpu` and `TotalMemory` for `vCluster`; `Capacity MiB`
  and `Free MiB` for `vDatastore`) — is recorded as an **unavailable**
  collection, the same explicit gap a live capture records for a denied
  query. It is never recorded as *empty*: a workbook with no `vHost` tab is
  not an estate with no hosts. A worksheet that is present with no rows *is*
  an answer, and is recorded as empty.
- A VM column that is missing (`CPUs`, `Memory`, `In Use MiB`) is reported as a
  coverage gap; the count is unknown, not zero.
- Health rules that need evidence the workbook never carries report
  unknown / not-evaluated instead of passing. The import claims only the
  inventory schema level its worksheets back: `2` by default, `3` with
  `vTools`, `4` with `vPartition`, `5` with `vPartition`'s `Disk Key` column.
- Resource pools and networks are **always** recorded unavailable. `vRP`
  carries pool configuration but only a VM *count*, never which VMs belong to a
  pool, so importing it would make every pool look empty; RVTools carries no
  managed-object ID for a network, so importing one would rest on a display
  name alone. `vHBA`, `vNIC`, `vSC+VMK` and `vMultiPath` (host storage and
  physical networking detail) are not yet mapped.
- With no `VI SDK UUID` column the endpoint stands in as the vCenter identity,
  as it does for a live capture, and the import says so.

### Identity

VMs are matched by managed-object ID, then instance UUID, then BIOS UUID; a
display name is used only when a row carries nothing stronger. Two vCenters
with an identically named VM stay two VMs, and a VM keeps its history across a
rename. An identity that two rows share is reported as an ambiguity and is
never resolved by guessing: both rows are kept, rows that reference the
ambiguous identity are not attached to either, and a repeated host, cluster,
datastore or distributed-switch `Object ID` makes that collection unavailable
for the context. Host networking rows join to their host by `Object ID` only,
and distributed port groups join to their switch by context, datacenter and
name — refused when that is not unique.

`--context-map KEY=NAME` renames a reconstructed context without touching
`config.toml`; an imported run's contexts are independent of it.

### Trends and partial runs

Because resource pools and networks are never importable, an imported run is
always `partial`. `assessment diff`, `vm history`, `findings` and `topology`
use it as-is, and say what they could not verify; the trend commands exclude
partial runs unless asked, so plot imported history with `--include-partial`:

```sh
vsfleet assessment trends snapshots --include-partial
vsfleet assessment trends capacity --include-partial
```

### Capture time

In order: `--captured-at`, the workbook's own document properties, then import
time. The run says which was used, and the run — and so history, diff and
trends — is stamped with the capture time, not the day of import (which is
recorded in the run's note). A filename is never parsed for a date.

### Repeating an import

Importing the same file again creates another run. It is detected by
fingerprint, warned about on stderr with the earlier run's ID, and never
blocked; `--allow-duplicate` silences the warning.

### Safety

Import is local file processing. The workbook is untrusted input: it is
size-limited before it is opened, decompression is bounded, worksheet row
counts are capped, no formula is evaluated and no external link is followed.
A failure at any point leaves no run behind.

## Topology and dependencies

Topology queries use the immutable assessment ledger and never contact a
vCenter. They join managed-object references, UUIDs, datastore backing
identity, distributed port-group keys, and context-scoped names across the
estate:

```sh
vsfleet topology vm app01 latest
vsfleet dependencies vm app01 --depth 2
vsfleet dependencies network prod-vlan-210 -o json | jq
vsfleet blast-radius datastore ds-prod-01 --all-contexts
vsfleet network compare cluster-prod cluster-dr -o json | jq '.differences, .mapping_gaps'
vsfleet assessment network-readiness --source cluster-prod --target cluster-dr --fail-on-blockers
```

`topology` shows containment and direct attachments. `dependencies` follows
objects a subject uses; `blast-radius` follows that relationship backwards.
Use `--context` when a name is ambiguous. Each result reports `complete`,
`partial`, or `unknown`, the checked contexts, the evidence basis for every
edge, unresolved references, and any collection that was blind. Strong joins
are confirmed; context-scoped display-name joins are inferred. Network
relationships reconstructed from runs captured before inventory schema 12 are
always partial.

`vsfleet doctor` diagnoses whether vsfleet can reach a vCenter, while
`vsfleet assessment doctor` checks the local history database. `vsfleet health`
and `vsfleet assessment findings` assess the estate described by stored
evidence. `assessment readiness` reports `unknown`, never `ready`, when a
required collection is blind.

`network compare` and `assessment network-readiness` compare the networks
reachable from two clusters using the same stored assessment ledger. Networks
match by VLAN first and by name when VLAN evidence is unavailable. The result
separates matched networks, source-only mapping gaps (including attached VMs),
target-only networks, and field-level VLAN, MTU, teaming, security, uplink, and
host-coverage differences. `network-readiness` reports `ready`, `blocked`, or
`unknown`; a missing network used by a VM or a hard policy/coverage mismatch is
a blocker. Blind collection evidence always produces `unknown`, and older or
partially reconstructable network evidence is marked with reduced confidence.

### VM decommission checks

`vsfleet vm decommission-check NAME_OR_UUID [RUN]` is an offline, read-only
review of one VM's stored assessment evidence. It never powers off, deletes,
unregisters, or otherwise changes a VM. The command searches every selected
context, joins observations by VM UUID when available, and returns every
distinct match when a name is ambiguous; use `--context` to narrow it.

The verdict is `no-blockers`, `blocked`, or `unknown` (schema version 2; earlier
releases used `ready` for `no-blockers`). `no-blockers` means every collected
technical gate passed; it is not authorization to delete the VM. Powered-on or
suspended VMs, snapshots, connected CD-ROM/USB devices, and inaccessible,
orphaned, disconnected, or invalid connection states are blockers. Missing
power, connection, hardware, dependency, or collection evidence is unknown.
Disk backing paths, datastore dependencies, network relationships, unresolved
references, and blind contexts are included as evidence. Ownership, backup
policy, and application-dependency evidence are reported as `not_assessed`
advisories because those fields are not part of the stored inventory yet; the
verdict never accounts for them.

The default run is `latest`; pass an explicit run ID or label for a reproducible
offline result. JSON is intended for automation, and `--fail-on-blockers`
returns exit code `2` only when a blocker is present:

```sh
vsfleet vm decommission-check legacy-db01 latest
vsfleet vm decommission-check legacy-db01 --context prod -o json
vsfleet vm decommission-check legacy-db01 --fail-on-blockers
```

## Export compatibility

`vsfleet compatibility report` describes what the `rvtools` export profile
writes: every worksheet, every column, each cell's type and unit, and when a
cell is left empty.

```sh
vsfleet compatibility report                      # every worksheet
vsfleet compatibility report --sheet vHBA         # one of them
vsfleet compatibility report -o json | jq         # for a pipeline
```

It reads no configuration, opens no keyring and contacts no vCenter, so it can
be used to decide whether an export fits a downstream pipeline before setting
vsfleet up at all. It is generated from the same definitions the exporter
writes from, so it cannot drift from the workbook.

It describes what vsfleet emits. It makes no claim about any other tool's
schema — compare it against what your pipeline requires.

## Assessments

Assessment captures are read-only and store their evidence locally. Add
`--browse-datastores` when the account has the vSphere `Datastore.Browse`
privilege and you want zombie-VMDK checks; the bounded file listing adds time on
large estates and is disabled by default.

```sh
vsfleet assessment run --all-contexts --browse-datastores
vsfleet health latest
vsfleet assessment orphans latest
vsfleet assessment capacity latest
```

Without the flag, `datastore-zombie-vmdk` is reported as `not-evaluated`, not as
a clean result. Orphan confidence is estate-aware: `--fail-on-findings
--severity warning` fails only on verified-unreferenced VMDKs; suspected and
cross-context evidence is informational, while incomplete coverage is unknown.
Use `assessment orphans [RUN]` for the evidence drill-down, with
`--confidence` and `--min-size` filters or `-o json` for automation. When a
datastore was not browsed (no `--browse-datastores`), failed, was denied, or was
truncated, the command prints `NOT EVALUATED` instead of a clean result, names
the datastores on stderr, and reports the same state under `coverage` in the
JSON output; `--fail-on-unknown` turns incomplete coverage into a non-zero exit.

`vsfleet assessment capacity [RUN]` is an offline growth drill-down. It joins
the first and last usable datastore observations in the selected window, names
VM, template, and file contributors, and projects when the configured free-space
floor will be crossed. `--min-free-bytes` adds an absolute floor to the default
percentage floor; the larger floor binds. Use `--since 30d`, `--datastore`, and
`--top` to narrow the report. Exact attribution requires complete datastore
browse listings in both endpoint runs; inferred attribution uses a
single-datastore VM's committed-storage change, and split attribution uses
per-disk provisioned capacity for VMs spanning datastores. A synthetic
`unattributed` contributor keeps the reported contributors equal to used-byte
growth. Projections are `unknown` when coverage or history is insufficient.

## Exit codes

A scheduled collection reacts to the exit code, so it is a contract rather than
an implementation detail:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | The command did what was asked |
| `1` | vsfleet could not do its job: bad configuration, an unreachable estate, an unreadable database |
| `2` | The tool worked and the estate did not pass: `assessment diff` policy violations, `health --fail-on-findings`, or `assessment readiness --fail-on-blockers` |
| `3` | A capture stored evidence from some contexts but not all — only with `assessment run --fail-on-partial` |

A partial capture exits `0` unless `--fail-on-partial` is passed, so upgrading
does not change what an existing scheduled job does.

## JSON output

Use `-o json` for automation. The output is designed for `jq`, `awk`, and other
pipeline consumers:

```sh
vsfleet vm list --all-contexts -o json
vsfleet search nvme --kind datastore -o json | jq
```

## Persistent flags

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--context <name>` | Scope a command to one or more named contexts |
| `--all-contexts` | Target every configured context |
| `--config <path>` | Override the TOML configuration path |
| `--history-db <path>` | Override the SQLite assessment database |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Per-vCenter request timeout (default `30s`) |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | Select human or machine-readable output |
| `--refresh <duration>` | Set or disable background TUI polling |

## Finding your way around

The built-in help is the exhaustive reference and always reflects the
installed binary. `-h` / `--help` works at every level of the tree, and every
command carries worked examples:

```sh
vsfleet --help                          # grouped by the job being done
vsfleet assessment --help               # what is under a command group
vsfleet assessment diff --help          # flags, arguments, and examples
vsfleet assessment trends capacity -h   # four levels deep, same thing
```

`vsfleet --help` groups the tree rather than listing it alphabetically:
getting started, inventory and search, assessment and history, analysis, and
diagnostics.

A mistyped command fails with a non-zero exit status and suggests the near
miss, so a typo in a scheduled job is never mistaken for success:

```console
$ vsfleet assessment lst
vsfleet: unknown command "lst" for "vsfleet assessment"

Did you mean this?
	list

Run 'vsfleet assessment --help' for the available commands.
```

Shell completion covers commands, flags, and the closed argument vocabularies
such as the `KIND` accepted by `topology`, `dependencies`, and `blast-radius`:

```sh
vsfleet completion bash --help   # and zsh, fish, powershell
```
