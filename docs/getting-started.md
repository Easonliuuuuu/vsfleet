# Getting Started

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```sh
brew install --cask easonliuuuuu/tap/vsfleet
```

### Pre-built release binary

Download an archive for your operating system and CPU architecture from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/releases) page.

```sh
# Example for Linux x86_64
curl -sSL https://github.com/Easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/releases/latest/download/vsfleet_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz vsfleet
sudo install -m 0755 vsfleet /usr/local/bin/
```

Archives are available for Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), and Windows
(amd64 and arm64).

### Go installation

Requires Go 1.25 or newer:

```sh
go install github.com/easonliuuuuu/vsfleet/cmd/vsfleet@latest
```

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Easonliuuuuu/vsfleet.git
cd vsfleet
go build -o vsfleet ./cmd/vsfleet
```

## Look around first

Before configuring anything, open the interface on sample data:

```sh
vsfleet demo
```

The demo is a synthetic three-vCenter estate: two healthy sites reached by
different routes, and one disaster-recovery site whose proxy refuses the
connection. It reads no configuration file, opens no keyring, resolves no
credentials, dials nothing, and writes nothing back — so it does not remember
the last screen the way a real run does. Every screen is marked
`DEMO · SAMPLE DATA`.

Historical assessments are unavailable in the demo: there is no captured run
behind the sample data to compare against.

## First context

If no contexts exist, running `vsfleet` opens the setup wizard:

```sh
vsfleet
```

You can also start it explicitly:

```sh
vsfleet context add
```

The wizard asks for an endpoint, username, route, certificate policy, and
password, then tests the connection before saving. Passwords are stored in the
OS keyring when available; headless systems use the safe `prompt` reference.

## Explore inventory

```sh
vsfleet context list
vsfleet context test prod
vsfleet status

vsfleet vm list
vsfleet vapp list
vsfleet host list
vsfleet datastore list

vsfleet search ubuntu --all-contexts
```

Use `--all-contexts` for an estate-wide operation or `--context NAME` to scope
one command. See the [CLI Guide](commands.md) for output and filtering.

## Shell completion

Generate completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, or PowerShell:

```sh
# Bash
vsfleet completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/vsfleet

# Zsh
vsfleet completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_vsfleet"

# Fish
vsfleet completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/vsfleet.fish
```

For the complete command, use `vsfleet completion --help`.
