# vSphere estate assessment and diagnostics across every vCenter

vsfleet is an open-source Go CLI and terminal UI for VMware vSphere operators
and site reliability engineers. It inspects inventory, diagnoses connectivity,
assesses migration readiness, and preserves historical observations across a
whole estate in one run — from Linux, macOS or Windows, with no GUI and no .NET
runtime. It organizes each vCenter into a named context, so you can search the
estate and compare changes without juggling browser tabs or scripts.

## Try it without a vCenter

```sh
vsfleet demo
```

The demo opens the interface on a synthetic three-vCenter estate — two healthy
sites and one whose proxy refuses the connection. It reads no configuration,
opens no keyring, dials nothing, and writes nothing back. Every screen is
marked `DEMO · SAMPLE DATA`.

> [!NOTE]
> vsfleet is a personal open-source project, not an official Dell Technologies

> Its export interoperability was independently implemented without RVTools
> source code or non-public documentation. RVTools is a Dell Technologies

## Export the estate for migration planning and sizing

```sh
vsfleet assessment run --all-contexts --label q3-audit
vsfleet assessment export --format rvtools --file estate.xlsx
```

The `rvtools` format renders a documented subset of worksheet layouts used by
RVTools exports: `vInfo`, `vCPU`, `vMemory`, `vDisk`, `vPartition`, `vNetwork`,
`vTools`, `vHost`, `vHBA`, `vNIC`, `vSwitch`, `vPort`, `vSC+VMK`, `vMultiPath`,
`vCluster`, `vRP`, `vDatastore`, `vSnapshot`, and `vHealth`.
This is an interoperability profile, not RVTools or a replacement for it — see
[Assessments](assessments.md) for the full tab reference and the
`vsfleetCoverage` sheet.

> changes networks, provisions resources, manages snapshots, or deletes
> inventory objects.

## Why vsfleet?

- Query every configured vCenter with one command using `--all-contexts`.
- Search VMs, templates, hosts, clusters, vApps, datastores, and networks
  across the estate.
- Keep healthy results usable when another vCenter is offline or timing out.
- Route each context independently through direct TCP, SOCKS5, HTTP, or HTTPS
  CONNECT proxies.
- Keep passwords in the operating system keyring, an interactive prompt, or an
  unattended source for cron, systemd, containers and CI;
  they never go into `config.toml`.
- Pin TLS thumbprints for private or self-signed vCenters.
- Capture immutable, local SQLite assessments and explain drift over time.
- Use a responsive Bubble Tea TUI or stable JSON output for automation.
