		Short: "Explore a sample estate without connecting to a vCenter",
		Example: `  # Open the interface on sample data
  vsfleet demo

  # Same, without the background refresh
  vsfleet demo --refresh -1`,
		Long: `Open the terminal interface on invented inventory.

The estate is three vCenters: two healthy sites reached by different routes
and one disaster-recovery site whose proxy refuses the connection. That last
one is the point — healthy results stay usable while another vCenter is down.

The main site is sized like production: about 1,000 VMs across six clusters,
36 datastores, 24 vApps (some nested), resource pools and 30 networks. The
second healthy site has about 180 VMs. Everything is generated
deterministically, so every run shows the same estate.

Nothing here touches your machine or your network. The demo reads no
configuration file, opens no keyring, resolves no credentials, dials nothing,
and writes nothing back: it does not remember the last screen the way a real
run does. The header says DEMO on every screen so a screenshot cannot be
mistaken for a live estate.

The History pane holds five seeded, in-memory assessments, dated May to
September, so diffs, trends, churn and capacity have real history. The newest
includes intentionally unhealthy orphaned-VM and zombie-VMDK evidence. Nothing
is written to disk.`,
