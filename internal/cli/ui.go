The numbered tabs show one resource kind at a time for the vCenter in scope
or, with --all-contexts, for the whole estate at once. Press "c" for the
contexts screen, which lists every configured vCenter whether or not it is
reachable and is where you switch, add, edit and remove them.

"/" filters the table in front of you and "tab" widens the same query into
every vCenter and every kind at once, which is "vsfleet search" without
leaving the interface. A vCenter that has not answered is reported as not
searched rather than quietly narrowing the result.

With no contexts configured yet, this opens straight into the setup form
instead of asking you to run "vsfleet context add" first.

The context, resource tab and sort order are remembered between runs, so
closing vsfleet and opening it again picks up where you left off. --context
overrides the remembered context for this run without changing what gets
remembered next time.

ask the same questions, not a second implementation of them.`,
