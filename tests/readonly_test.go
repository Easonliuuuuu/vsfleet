// This file is the standing proof that vsfleet is read-only against a real
// vCenter. Reading the source says the same thing — nothing imports
// govmomi/object, where every mutating operation lives — but source reading
// is not evidence anyone can re-run before pointing this at production. This
// records every SOAP operation the tool actually puts on the wire during a
// full exercise of every command that talks to vCenter, and fails on
// anything outside a small, explicitly justified allowlist.
//
// The allowlist is deliberately exhaustive rather than a deny-list of known
// dangerous verbs: a new call has to be justified here before it can ship,
// which is the property that actually protects an operator's estate.
//
// What this guarantees is specifically about the vSphere API: vsfleet cannot
// mutate a vCenter's state through it. The TUI's detail-pane handoff actions
// (package tui, see actions.go) are a deliberately separate class of action
// outside that guarantee — SSH, "open in browser" and clipboard copy launch
// real local processes on the operator's own workstation, through
// os/exec and a browser, never through vSphere's SOAP or REST APIs. That is
// why they are not, and should not be, reachable from this file's allowlist
// or from mutatingPackages below: the guarantee this file proves is that
// vsfleet's own calls to vCenter cannot cause harm, not that every action a
// keypress can trigger is a no-op.

// readOnlyMethods are the vSphere operations vsfleet is allowed to invoke.
//
// Several of these are not literal reads, and each is here for a stated
// reason. What they have in common is that every object they create or
// destroy is one this tool made for its own query, is scoped to this
// session, and holds nothing but references — none of them can reach an
// object in inventory.
//
//   - Login/Logout create and release a session. Nothing else can be read
//     without one, and Logout is what keeps abandoned sessions from
//     lingering for half an hour on someone else's vCenter.
//   - CreateContainerView/DestroyView create and destroy a transient,
//     session-scoped view object — the standard govmomi way to enumerate
//     inventory. A view holds references to objects; creating one changes
//     nothing about the objects themselves, and destroying it is the cleanup
//     of the thing this tool just created, never of anything in inventory.
//   - CreatePropertyCollector/CreateFilter/DestroyPropertyCollector are the
//     same bargain for the paged read the interface uses on a large estate.
//     The filter describes which properties to report; the collector is a
//     private cursor over them, needed because the shared default collector
//     serves one caller at a time and the interface reads several resource
//     kinds at once. Destroying the collector releases the filter with it.
//     DestroyPropertyFilter is therefore absent: it is never called.
//
// Everything else is a pure read.
//
// Nothing else belongs here without a specific reason. In particular
// RetrieveManagedMethodExecuter is deliberately absent: it is a mechanism
// for invoking arbitrary operations, so approving it would defeat the point
// of the list.
